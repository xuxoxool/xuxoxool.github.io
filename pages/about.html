		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		
		<p>My name is Zul Zolkaffly, from Puchong, Selangor, Malaysia. I am a <span id="ageYears"></span> years old Malay male, married Malaysian citizen.
			I am a Senior Front End Web Developer, working with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery for UI/UX Development.</p>
		
		<p>
			I have <span id="totalYears"></span> years of experience in various fields (<span id="careerYears"></span> Years professional, 3 years during college). 
			I started off my career as an Engineer, then I submitted to my passion of being a web programmer and designer.
			Even though I came from an engineering background, I've always have a passion in programming. I spent my free time during college learning how to
			code, and this habit of mine stays with me until today. I usually got involved in developing web system, but nowadays I spent a lot of time doing
			front end development.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I received a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering, concentration of Robotics, Signal and System from Vanderbilt University, USA.
			After graduating in 2010, I was offered the position
			as Manufacturing Engineer at Portescap. After Portescap closed down at the end of 2012, I received an offer as a QA/QC Engineer at Transnorm
			Systems Sdn. Bhd. However, I was not long there because I received and offer as a programmer at Infrastructure University Kuala Lumpur in
			early 2013. After 3 years at IUKL, I continue my career as a Senior Programmer at Salihin Consulting Group starting August of 2016.
			I ended my service at Salihin in September 2017 and furthering my career as a senior front end web developer at Innovez-One, Puchong.
		</p>
